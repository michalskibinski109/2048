# 2048 Game

This project implements the popular game 2048. The game is built using a combination of Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- The game is played on a grid with dimensions defined by the `shape` argument.
- The game starts with two tiles, each with a value of either 2 or 4.
- The player can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- When two tiles with the same value collide while moving, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their values.
- After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 appears on the board.
- The goal of the game is to reach a tile with a value of 2048.
